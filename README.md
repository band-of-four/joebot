_Taki_ ([Polish](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/taki#Polish) for _such_) is a guessing game
for chatrooms where people think they know each other well :^)

## Getting up & running

1. Use [VkOpt](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vkopt/hoboppgpbgclpfnjfdidokiilachfcbb)
to export any VKontakte chat you'd like to use for the _Taki_ game
(be sure to select the _Export as .html_ option)
2. Save the chat history file as `messages.html` and place it in the crate root.
3. ??? (WIP)
